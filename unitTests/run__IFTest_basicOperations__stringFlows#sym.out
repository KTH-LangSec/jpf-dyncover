OUTPUT FLOW GRAPH:
([root, end, V0, V1], [(root,V0), (V0,end), (root,V1), (V1,end)])

Contains variables: i

V0 = “Yep3Ok” [[ IFF i = 3 ]] [[ UTC vacuously true ]]
V1 = “Hmm3NO” [[ IFF i ≠ 3 ]] [[ UTC vacuously true ]]


INTERFERENCE FORMULA:
vacuously true ∧ vacuously true ∧ vacuously false ∧ (i ≠ 3 ∧ (¬ (i_bis ≠ 3 ∧ “Hmm3NO” = “Hmm3NO”) ∧ ¬ (i_bis = 3 ∧ “Yep3Ok” = “Hmm3NO”)) ∨ i = 3 ∧ (¬ (i_bis ≠ 3 ∧ “Hmm3NO” = “Yep3Ok”) ∧ ¬ (i_bis = 3 ∧ “Yep3Ok” = “Yep3Ok”)))

SIMPLIFIED INTERFERENCE FORMULA:
vacuously true ∧ vacuously true ∧ vacuously false ∧ (i ≠ 3 ∧ (¬ (i_bis ≠ 3 ∧ “Hmm3NO” = “Hmm3NO”) ∧ ¬ (i_bis = 3 ∧ “Yep3Ok” = “Hmm3NO”)) ∨ i = 3 ∧ (¬ (i_bis ≠ 3 ∧ “Hmm3NO” = “Yep3Ok”) ∧ ¬ (i_bis = 3 ∧ “Yep3Ok” = “Yep3Ok”)))

SMT-BASED VERIFICATION: The program is noninterfering.
